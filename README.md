Title:

PackBack – A Verified Brand-Specific Recycling Reward App

Problem Description:

Single-use packaging waste from branded products is a major contributor to environmental pollution. Existing recycling systems lack proper verification, incentives, and end-to-end tracking, resulting in low user participation and inefficient waste management. There is no reliable mechanism to ensure that collected packaging is actually recycled or decomposed responsibly. Brands have limited visibility into the lifecycle of their packaging waste, and consumers receive no direct benefit for responsible disposal. The absence of multi-level verification and accountability causes most recyclable packaging to end up in landfills instead of authorized recycling facilities.

Objectives:

The primary objective of PackBack is to create a verified, incentive-driven recycling ecosystem for branded packaging waste. The system aims to encourage users to return used packets by offering brand-specific rewards while ensuring accuracy through shopkeeper verification. By enabling scrap buyers and authorized recycling partners to scan and re-verify collected waste, PackBack ensures that all materials are properly processed and decomposed in an environmentally safe manner. Additionally, the platform seeks to provide brands with transparent data on packaging recovery and support a sustainable circular economy involving consumers, shops, scrap buyers, and recyclers.

Scope:

The scope of PackBack includes the collection of used packaging from partnered brands through local retail shops acting as verified collection points. The application supports QR-based submission and validation of packets by shopkeepers to ensure accurate user input. A brand-specific point system rewards users and shopkeepers with discounts applicable only to the brands they recycle. Scrap buyers and authorized recycling companies are also provided with scanning access to re-verify collected waste, ensuring it is properly processed and decomposed in an environmentally safe manner. The system enables centralized disposal and data tracking for impact analysis.

Constraints:

The system depends on the active participation of brands, shopkeepers, and scrap buyers for smooth operation. Internet connectivity is required for scanning and real-time data synchronization. Initial setup costs include QR infrastructure and scanner access for shops and scrap buyers. Coordination between multiple stakeholders may pose operational challenges during early stages.

Deliverables:

The project will deliver a mobile application with separate modules for users, shopkeepers, and scrap buyers. It includes a QR-based multi-level verification system, a brand-wise reward points wallet with discount redemption, and a centralized admin dashboard for monitoring waste flow from collection to decomposition. A detailed presentation demonstrating the verified circular recycling process and environmental impact will also be provided.
